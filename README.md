# PredictingSepsis3

The project uses the following Kaggle Dataset found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/sepsis-survival-minimal-clinical-records

I have included the files in this repository for you convenience, but I do not own any of the data, as the dataset is all thanks to the Kaggle page linked up above. 

I have included extensive notes on both python files on the results and their interpretations.
